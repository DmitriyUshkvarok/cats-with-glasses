            <p class="panel-info">I am a student, that's why I should read a lot
                of books. I like reading. Literature
                means a
                lot in my life. It helps me
                to understand other people better. I often analyze the
                characters of the books and it helps me to
                understand the
                world
                and myself. I read books by different authors: Russian,
                Ukrainian, German, and English.

                My favourite Russian writer is Darya Dontsova. She is a popular
                Russian writer of modern prose. The
                works of
                this author
                are smart and really interesting. According to her own words,
                her novels are based on real facts. That
                arouses
                the
                reader's interest and provokes their own analysis of the events.
                When I got acquainted with her books, I
                was
                really
                impressed by her wit and humor. The main characters often find
                themselves in a difficult situation, but
                they do
                not give
                up and try to find the way out. Some of the characters of her
                books are mean and jealous. Some of them
                are
                deeply
                feeling, faithful and tender.

                When I read books by my favourite author, Darya Dontsova, I have
                a feeling that I may meet her
                characters even
                in my
                native town. I always try to watch an interview on TV with Darya
                Dontsova. She has a happy family that
                supports
                her in
                her work and in difficult situations. She has a strong
                character, and she is optimistic. Her brain works
                as a
                good
                computer and she knows how to derive benefit from it. I always
                recommend my friends to read her books.
